# Modular Payload System Specifications
Revision: Draft

## Overview
These specifications are split into two categories, General Requirements that all module developers shall follow, and a following section that pertains only to modules that meet the High Reliability Requirements (HR)

## Naming Conventions

Bus modules have a basic naming scheme in the format XXX-NNM, for example CPU-010. The prefix letters define the type of module. The two numbers NN define the board number. The last number M, defines the assembly variant. 

| Prefix | Type                                                         |
| :----: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  PSU   | Power Supply Module. Should also be used for power related modules, if for example, you needed to power external devices from the BUS rails. |
|  DBG   | Debug/Development Module                                     |
|  TOP   | Top Module. Design to terminate the top of the stack.        |
|  BOT   | Bottom Module. Design to terminate the bottom of the stack.  |
|  CPU   | Flight Computer Module                                       |
|   IO   | IO board. Includes modules for driving relays, pyros, etc.   |
|  BAT   | Battery Module. This is any module that generates the +VBAT rail. |
|  AUX   | Auxiliary Modules for doing *weird* stuff.                   |
|  TMP   | Template Modules                                             |



## General Specifications
1. Documentation
   1. Module naming shall conform to the naming convention outlined in this document. (This is not required for 3rd party modules, but is required if they will be contributed to LBR's repository.)
   2. Module schematics shall be licensed CC BY-NC 4.0
   3. A compliance matrix shall be filled out. A template one can be generated using by running ```python ./Scripts/generate-compliance-matrix.py ``` from the root directory of this repository. (This is not required for 3rd party modules, but is required if they will be contributed to LBR's repository.)
2. Performance
   1. Electrical connectors shall have continuous current carrying capacity derated to 80%.
   2. Ceramic capacitors shall be derated to 60% operating Voltage. Partial non compliance here is acceptable if the derating failure is only due to voltage rail tolerance. I.e.. a 10V capacitor is acceptable on a 5V rail.
   3. Polymer tantalum capacitors shall be derated to 80% operating Voltage
   4. Polymer tantalums shall be sourced from reputable manufacturers (KEMET, AVX, etc.) No other type of polarized capacitor should be used. (The goal here is to provide safe operation for the entire bus in hot environments and at high altitudes/low pressure. Deviation from this requirement is allowed, but should be done with caution)
   5. Tjmax for all ICs and components shall be derated to 80%
   6. All passive electrical components shall be AEC-Q200 qualified
   7. All discrete components shall be AEC-Q101 qualified
   8. All IC should be AEC-Q100 qualified. If the IC is not AEC-Q100 qualified, then it should have a pin compatible/orderable part that is AEC-Q100 qualified. (The goal here is that if the user wants to pay the extra or jump through the purchasing hurdles to actually get an AEC-Q100 part then they can, but it should be the same. For example the ATSAMC21 that is planned for this project has a AEC-Q100 qualified PN suffix, but they are non-stock. We would have to order a full reel. But by using this part, we have the option to simply order the AEC-Q100 part in the future if needed.)
   9. When digital communication and clocks greater than 25.575Mhz are used, the frequency should be chosen such that there are no odd harmonics in the L1 GPS band (1575.42 MHz Â± 15.345 MHz). Digital frequencies keep out table included for reference below. For example, clock frequencies of 48MHz are not allow because they are between 47.275MHz and 48.205MHz and will produce a 33rd harmonic in the L1 GPS band. 48.25MHz, for example is allowed. If frequencies are used that are in the frequency keep out regions, shielding options should be evaluated in order to prevent interference with GPS receivers. If an applications uses GPS other than L1, a frequency keep out table should be made by dividing the the upper and lower bandwidth limits of the band by odd divisors. See [Table 1](###Table 1)

          5. All modules that generate the +VBAT rail via switching regulator topologies shall be 100% tested to ensure conformance to operating voltage requirement.

       8. DETECT_A/DETECT_B
          1. Reference: The DETECT_A and DETECT_B signals are used to autodetect the order of the Modules within a stack. This is the only signal in the bus that is not connected to all of the modules in parallel to P1 and J1. DETECT_A is only present on P1 while DETECT_B is only present on J1. DETECT_B should be configured as an input to the microcontroller with a pullup (external or internal to the microcontroller ) When this net is pulled low, the Module should identify itself on the CAN bus. The module will then drive DETECT_A low to request the next module in the stack to identify itself. The bottom board in the stack ties detect to GND to start the detect process. It is recommended that all Modules that have a microcontroller use this detect feature. See [Figure 1](###Figure 1) for an example of how this detect signal could be wired up between modules.
          2. If the detect signal is used in the Module, the detect net tied to J1 (top side connector) shall be called DETECT_A and the detect net tied to P1 (bottom side connector) shall be called DETECT_B.
          3. If the detect signal is used in the Module, DETECT_B shall be configured as an input with a pullup resistor between 2kohm and 500kohm.
          4. If the detect signal is used in the Module, DETECT_A shall be configured as an open collector/drain output. It shall remain in a hi-z or pullup state until the module has finished its detect sequence, at which time it will drive the DETECT_A net low.
          5. If the detect signal is not used in the Module, The net shall tie J1 to P1 and shall be called Detect.
          6. Bottom modules (BOT-NNM) shall tie DETECT_A to GND.
          7. Top modules (TOP-NNM) shall leave DETECT_B floating.
       9. P_GOOD
          1. Reference: The P_GOOD signal is intended to be to power on reset signal for the bus. It can be used to enable local 3.3V LDOs or tied to the rest pin of a microcontroller. This allows the power supplies to come up, then assert the P_GOOD signal in order to enable the rest of the modules. The P_GOOD net is driven through a 220ohm series resistor and a Schottky diode and has a 100kohm pulldown. The goal of the current requirement on this net is to keep the P_GOOD rail from sagging excessively under load. Pulldowns on every module and the Iq of any enable pin may quickly exceed the expected current on this net. The exception the current requirements is reset buttons or other reset features. P_GOOD can be tied low which will draw ~10mA, which will hold the modules in reset.
          2. The P_GOOD signal shall be asserted to 3.3V (2.2V min. 3.6V max.) after VBAT, 12V, and 5V rails have reached operating voltage
          3. The P_GOOD signal shall be de-asserted if any of the rails fall below operating range after ~1ms of persistence
          4. The total amount of current sinked from this net shall be < 1.8 mA during operation.
          5. The total amount of current sinked per module from this net should be < 150uA during operation.
3. Mechanical
    1. Connectors
        1. Top side stacking BUS connectors shall be given ref des J1 and J2 for the signal and power connectors respectively
        2. J1 and J2 shall match in part number.
        3. J1 and J2 shall be part number 10144517-061802LF, 10144517-062802LF, 10144517-063802LF, or 10144517-064802LF
        4. Bottom side stacking BUS connectors shall be given ref des P1 and P2 for the signal and power connectors respectively
        5. P1 and P2 shall be part number 10144518-064802LF
        6. If the Module uses SWD or JTAG for programming, a standard 2x5 0.05" pitch right angle box header should be used as a programming connector. This allows for consistency between modules.
        7. If the Module uses a debug UART, a S4B-ZR(LF)(SN) should be used as a debug UART connector (pin 1: +3.3V, pin 2: GND, pin 3: DEBUG_TX, pin 4: DEBUG_RX). This allows for consistency between modules.
    2. Component Height
          1. Component height limits on the top side of the board are defined by the stacking connectors. See [Table 2](###Table 2)    
          2. Component height limit on the bottom side of the board is 152 mil     
    3. Stack Height
          4. Reference: Module to Module stack heights are defined by the top side connector. This stack height is defined by the top side of one module to the bottom side of the module above it. i.e. not including board thickness. See  [Table 3](###Table 3)
    5. Board Outline
          1. Modules should be 1.750" by 1.750" with a 0.125" radius on the corners (This specification may be violated and should be evaluated on a case by case basis.)
    6. Mounting Holes
          1. Modules shall have mounting holes sized for M3 standoffs (126mil nom. drill diameter with a 218mil nom. pad diameter) located at 0.125" from the edge of the 1.75" square
    7. Board thickness
          1. Module PCBs should be 63mil nom. thickness. (This allows for the use of standard standoffs for module stacking. This specification may be violated if alternate standoffs are used)
    10. Test Points
          1. SMT test points should be at least 40mil in diameter
          2. SMT test points should be located on a 0.1â grid on the board. Per **TBD** drawing. (This allows for a standardized pogo pin test board that picks up on this grid. Save from having to create a pogo pin board for each module)
          3. SMT test points should be on top side of the board. (Bottom side test points are allowed, but will be difficult to get to within the stack!)

## High Reliability Specifications

1. Performance
   1. Switching regulators shall have a gain margin of 10dB or greater and a phase margin of 35 degrees or greater
   2. Switching regulators shall have stability performance verified by Monte-Carlo Simulation over load and over component tolerance.
   3. Switching regulators shall have stability performance verified by test at nominal load.
   4. Linear regulators shall have a phase margin of 35 degrees or greater
   5. Linear regulators shall have stability performance verified by test at nominal load.
   6. All ICs and discrete electrical components shall be analyzed to ensure TJ MAX is not exceeded under max load.
